# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:


1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?

2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?

3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?

4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?

5. What are the most optimal skills¬†to¬†learn?

# Tools I used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.


- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.



- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

 - **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project¬†tracking. 

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.

Here's how I approached each question:



### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities¬†in¬†the¬†field.
``` sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    cd.name as company_name,
    job_posted_date
From 
    job_postings_fact as jpf
LEFT JOIN company_dim as cd
on jpf.company_id=cd.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short='Data Analyst' and 
    job_location='Anywhere' and 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
limit 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs :

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
 To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

 ``` sql
 
with top_paying_jobs as (

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,

    salary_year_avg,
    cd.name as company_name
  
From 
    job_postings_fact as jpf
LEFT JOIN company_dim as cd
on jpf.company_id=cd.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short='Data Analyst' and 
    job_location='Anywhere' and 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
limit 10
)
select 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
from top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on top_paying_jobs.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC

 ```
Here are the top insights from the skills column for the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst roles:
SQL is the top-listed skill (8/10 jobs), emphasizing its critical role in querying and managing data in nearly all analyst positions.

Python (7 mentions) is highly sought after for its versatility in data analysis, automation, and machine learning. Combined with Pandas (3 mentions), it's clear Python's ecosystem is favored.

Tableau (6 mentions) shows that data visualization skills are just as important as analytical abilities.

R (4 mentions) still holds relevance, particularly in roles requiring statistical analysis and modeling.

Snowflake, Excel, and Pandas reflect the need for comfort with both cloud-based and traditional data tools.

Azure and Bitbucket indicate a shift toward cloud infrastructure and version control, suggesting that data analysts are increasingly expected to work in tech-driven, collaborative environments.

Go, while not typically associated with analyst roles, suggests some companies are valuing analysts who can interact with backend or system-level codebases, possibly in more technical or hybrid roles.
