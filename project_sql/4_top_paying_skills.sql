/*
1. üß† Specialized/Enterprise Tools Drive High Pay
Tools like PySpark, DataRobot, and Watson top the list ‚Äî reflecting the high value placed on big data, ML automation, and AI platforms in modern analytics roles.

These often relate to enterprise-scale data pipelines, which command premium salaries due to complexity and fewer experts.

2. üíª Version Control & DevOps Integration
Tools like Bitbucket, GitLab, Jenkins, and Atlassian indicate that DevOps skills are becoming more integrated into analytics roles.

Analysts who can work with CI/CD systems or collaborate with engineering teams earn more.

3. üî¨ ML & Scientific Computing Libraries
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter notebooks ‚Äî all reflect the growing demand for data science and machine learning skills.

These skills link analytics work with modeling, experimentation, and automation, boosting pay.

4. ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Distributed Systems
GCP, Airflow, Kubernetes, Databricks, and Hadoop show that cloud-native analysts and data engineers are highly compensated.

The ability to deploy data pipelines and work on distributed systems is key to upper-tier roles.

5. üß∞ Less Common, Niche Tools Pay Well
Tools like Couchbase, Crystal, Twilio, and MicroStrategy suggest that niche skills often lead to less competition and higher pay ‚Äî especially in companies where those tools are core to infrastructure.

6. üõ†Ô∏è Cross-functional Collaboration
Tools like Confluence, Notion, and Atlassian reflect the importance of documentation, project management, and collaboration platforms ‚Äî increasingly expected even in technical roles.
